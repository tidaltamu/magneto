Magneto: Machine learning to control and predict magnetic materials properties. This could be for other related materials such as superconducting material, magnetic shape memory alloys, alloys exhibiting spin glass, etc. Leveraging data science, this project is an exploratory research project to identify important features to magnetic properties, classification of magnetic properties and microstructure, and optimization of specific magnetic property responses.
